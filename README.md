# Tennis-Projects-Work

Hello! My name is Brady Anderson and I am currently about to finish my MS in Statistics at the University of Iowa.

Included in this collection is most of my code work in R centered around professional men's tennis (the greatest sport), which includes:

1. My first simple probit regression model for ATP matches over a few month time frame using the Universal Tennis Rating or UTR (in 2016)
2. My Game Theory undergraduate thesis, which looked at the Mixed Strategy Equilibrium economic theory applied to serving locations
3. My Master's Thesis Creative Component, which focused on building a wide variety of statistical learning models and comparing performances in predicting ATP outcomes
4. An R Shiny interactive database to pull/filter from the Match Charting Project and save matches smoothly

Projects 2-4 were all done thanks to use of Jeff Sackmann's Match Charing Project dataset.
